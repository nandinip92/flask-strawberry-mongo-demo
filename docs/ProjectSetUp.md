# Project setup

## 1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it

```bash
mkdir flask-strawberry-mongo-demo
cd flask-strawberry-mongo-demo
```

## 2. Create a virtual environment and activate it

Itâ€™s best practice to use a virtual environment for each Python project. This isolates your projectâ€™s dependencies from other projects or the system Python, avoids version conflicts, and makes it easier to share your project with others.

```bash
python -m venv venv        # Create a virtual environment

# Activate it:
# Windows (command prompt):
.venv\Scripts\ctivate

# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Git Bash on Windows
source venv/Scripts/activate

# Linux/MacOS:
source venv/bin/activate
```

While activated, any packages you install will only affect this project.

### Why Create a Virtual Environment?

1. **Isolate Dependencies**  
   Each Python project may need different libraries or versions. A virtual environment ensures your projectâ€™s dependencies donâ€™t conflict with others.

2. **Avoid System Pollution**  
   Installing packages globally can clutter your system Python and might require admin rights. A venv keeps them local.

3. **Reproducibility**  
   Using `requirements.txt`, others can recreate the same environment with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. **Safe Experimentation**  
   You can try new packages or versions without affecting other projects or your system Python.

## 3. Install Required Dependencies

With the virtual environment active, install Flask, Strawberry GraphQL, Flask-PyMongo, and PyMongo:

```bash
pip install Flask strawberry-graphql flask-pymongo pymongo
```

### Explanation of Each Package

- **Flask** â€“ A lightweight WSGI web framework for building web applications and APIs.
- **strawberry-graphql** â€“ A modern Python library for creating GraphQL APIs with simple and type-safe schemas.
- **flask-pymongo** â€“ A Flask extension that integrates PyMongo, making it easier to connect Flask with MongoDB.
- **pymongo** â€“ The official MongoDB driver for Python, providing low-level database interaction.

## 4. Save Dependencies to requirements.txt

After installing the packages, generate a requirements.txt file so others (or yourself on another machine) can recreate the same environment:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Example content of `requirements.txt`:

```ini
Flask==2.3.2
strawberry-graphql==0.211.0
flask-pymongo==2.3.0
pymongo==4.7.0
```

Others can install the same packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 5. Add `.gitignore`

Make sure to ignore your virtual environment folder in Git so it doesnâ€™t get committed to the repository.

Add this to your `.gitignore` file:

```bash
venv/
```

This ensures that only your code and requirements.txt are tracked, while the virtual environment (which can be recreated anytime) is excluded.

---

**Important:**

- Run `pip install` commands only after creating and activating the virtual environment.
- If the virtual environment is not active, packages will be installed globally on your system Python, which may cause conflicts with other projects.

## 6. Deactivate the virtual environment

When youâ€™re done working on your project, you can deactivate the virtual environment to return to the global Python environment:

```bash
deavtivate
```

ðŸ‘‰ After deactivating, your terminal will no longer show (venv) in the prompt, meaning youâ€™re back to the system Python.
